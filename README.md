# Array
In JavaScript, an array is a list-like structure with no fixed length which can hold any type of primitives or objects, even mixed types.

To create an array, add elements between square brackets [ ]. To read from the array, put the index in square brackets [ ] after the identifier. The indices of an array start at zero.

For example:
```js
const numbers = [1, 'two', 3, 'four'];
numbers[2]; // Output: 3

```
To retrieve the number of elements that are in an array, use the length property:
```
const numbers = [1, 'two', 3, 'four'];
numbers.length; // => 4
```
To change an element in the array, you assign a value at the index:
```
const numbers = [1, 'two', 3, 'four'];
numbers[0] = 'one';
numbers;
```
# Methods

Some of the methods that are available on every Array object can be used to add or remove from the array. Here are a few to consider when working on this exercise:
## push

A value can be added to the end of an array by using .push(value). The method returns the new length of the array.
```
const numbers = [1, 'two', 3, 'four'];
numbers.push(5); // => 5
numbers;
// => [1, 'two', 3, 'four', 5]
```
## pop

The last value can be removed from an array by using .pop() The method returns the removed value. The length of the array will be decreased because of this change.
```
const numbers = [1, 'two', 3, 'four'];
numbers.pop(); // => four
numbers;
// => [1, 'two', 3]
```
## shift

The first value can be removed from an array by using .shift() The method returns the removed value. The length of the array will be decreased because of this change.
```
const numbers = [1, 'two', 3, 'four'];
numbers.shift(); // => 1
numbers;
// => ['two', 3, 'four']
```
## unshift

A value can be added to the beginning of an array by using .unshift(value). The method returns the new length of the array.
```
const numbers = [1, 'two', 3, 'four'];
numbers.unshift('one'); // => 5
numbers;
// => ['one', 1, 'two', 3, 'four']
```
## splice

A value at a specific index can be removed from an array by using .splice(index, 1). The method returns the removed element(s).
```
const numbers = [1, 'two', 3, 'four'];
numbers.splice(2, 1, 'one'); // => [3]
numbers;
// => [1, 'two', 'one', 'four']
```
# for Loop
The for loop is one of the most commonly used statements to repeatedly execute some logic. In JavaScript, it consists of the for keyword, a header wrapped in round brackets and a code block that contains the body of the loop wrapped in curly brackets.
```
for (initialization; condition; step) {
  // code that is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true
}
```
The initialization usually sets up a counter variable, the condition checks whether the loop should be continued or stopped and the step increments the counter at the end of each repetition. The individual parts of the header are separated by semicolons.
```
const list = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
  // code that should be executed for each item list[i]
}
```
Defining the step is often done using JavaScript's increment or decrement operator as shown in the example above. These operators modify a variable in place. ++ adds one to a number, -- subtracts one from a number.
```
let i = 3;
i++;
// i is now 4

let j = 0;
j--;
// j is now -1
```
# While Loops

With a while loop, you can execute code repeatably as long as a certain condition is fulfilled. It is written with the while keyword followed by a condition wrapped in round brackets and a code block that contains the body of the loop wrapped in curly brackets.
```
while (condition) {
  // code that is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true
}
```
JavaScript also has a do-while loop. Here the condition is checked after the loop body was executed. This is useful when the condition depends on evaluations done in the body.
```
do {
  // The code here will always be executed once and then
  // repeatedly while the condition is true.
} while (condition);
```
Inside a loop body, you can use the break keyword to stop the execution of the loop entirely. In contrast to this, the keyword continue only stops the execution of the current iteration and continues with the next one. With continue you can often avoid wrapping big parts of the loop body in an if-statement.
```
let i = 0;

while (i < 100) {
  i = i + 2;

  if (i % 3 === 0) {
    continue;
  }

  // The code here will only be executed when i was not divisible
  // by 3 in the check above.
}
```
# Switch Statements

Besides the if-statement, JavaScript also has a switch-statement to conditionally execute logic. It is used when a single variable needs to be compared to multiple variants. The comparison is done by checking for strict equality (===), see concept comparison. For some variable x, the switch statement in JavaScript has the following syntax.
```
switch (x) {
  case option1:
    // code that is executed when "x === option1" is true
    break;
  case option2:
    // code that is executed when "x === option2" is true
    break;
  default:
    // code that is executed when x does not equal any of the options
}
```
The default case is optional and used in case you want to execute some code if none of the other options match the variable.

The break statements above are needed because by default all cases are "fallthrough" in JavaScript. That means without any break statement all the code in the cases below the first matching option would be executed even though x did not match those options. This "fallthrough by default" behavior is a common pitfall when using switch in JavaScript. Inside a function, return can also be used instead of break to avoid this problem.
